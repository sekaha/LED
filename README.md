A python package for creating and simulating graphical applications that display on an LED grid. The package is fully documented and designed to be versatile, but very easy to use. Take a look at the examples to see just how easy it is to an idea from your hand into code using the LED package!

A fractal zoomer, the coolest part about this is that the [code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sekaha/LED/refs/heads/main/Examples/fractal.py) fits in just 46 lines, including white spaces and comments (or it used to at least lol, I made modifications since, but you can find it in the git history)!

N-dimensional hypercubes are a fun little feature in the LED package, here you can see a 3D cube and a 4D tesseract.
