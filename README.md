# WiLED

A Python package for creating and simulating graphical applications that display on an LED grid. The package is fully documented, designed to be versatile, and very easy to use. Take a look at the examples to see just how simple it is to turn your ideas into code using the WiLED package!

### LEDoom
A neon-soaked, space-themed FPS inspired by Doom, running at 7.5% of the original’s resolution (~1/5th the resolution of a Game Boy). Built using the classic raycasting method with some nice modern touches like a dynamic lighting engine, procedural gun sway, recoil, firing animations, and particle effects :). There's a number of interesting things going on here to make the pixel art feel more fluid, mip-mapping, and pixel-art orientated rotation algorithms are probably the biggest two. Check out the timelapse:

### Top-down Pseudo-3D Procedurally Generated Rogue-like Shooter
A top-down, pseudo-3D, procedurally generated rogue-like shooter, with full native controller support. Made during a hackathon and finished over the weekend after the hackathon.

### Fractal Zoomer
The coolest part about this is that the [code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sekaha/LED/refs/heads/main/Examples/fractal.py) fits in just 46 lines, including whitespace and comments (or at least it did—I've made some modifications since, but you can find it in the git history)!

### Voronoi-esque Graphics Visualization
A Voronoi-esque graphics visualization, all in just [30 lines](https://github.com/sekaha/LED/blob/main/Examples/crystals.py), including whitespace and comments!

### N-dimensional Hypercubes
N-dimensional hypercubes are a fun feature in the LED package. Here you can see a 3D cube and a 4D tesseract.
