### Fractal Zoomer
The coolest part about this is that the [code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sekaha/LED/refs/heads/main/Examples/fractal.py) fits in just 46 lines, including whitespace and comments (or at least it didâ€”I've made some modifications since, but you can find it in the git history)!

### Voronoi-esque Graphics Visualization
A Voronoi-esque graphics visualization, all in just [30 lines](https://github.com/sekaha/LED/blob/main/Examples/crystals.py), including whitespace and comments!
